# The port on which the Sentinel should run

# monitor the Primary on a specific IP address and port. Having the address of the Primary the Sentinels will be able to discover all the replicas on their own. The last argument on this line is the number of Sentinels needed for quorum. In our example - the number is 2.

# if a Sentinel voted another Sentinel for the failover of a given master, it will wait this many milliseconds to try to failover the same master again.

# In order for Sentinels to connect to Redis server instances when they are configured with requirepass, the Sentinel configuration must include the sentinel auth-pass directive.
